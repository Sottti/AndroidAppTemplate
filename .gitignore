# It's a good practice to start with a comment explaining the file's purpose.
# This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore in the project.

#  Build Artifacts

# is usually sufficient for all modules.

#  Screenshot Exception
# ===============================================
# The following rules ensure that the 'art/screenshots' directory is
# ALWAYS included in source control, even if a broader rule below
# tries to ignore it.

# First, ensure the parent 'art' directory is not ignored.
!/art/

# Then, specifically un-ignore the screenshots directory and all its contents.
!/art/screenshots/
!/art/screenshots/**
