## Disclaimer

This repository intentionally demonstrates a production-ready architecture suited for teams that
need to scale quickly and collaborate across multiple features. Elements such as multi-module
structure, repository and use-case layers, and other advanced patterns are included to showcase how
large, collaborative projects can stay maintainable over time. They may be unnecessary for smaller
apps or teams with different preferences. Evaluate each practice against your team's size, project
scope, and delivery goals before adopting it wholesale.

## Overview

This project serves as a starter kit for new Android applications. It's designed to save you from
the repetitive setup process of configuring dependencies, setting up architecture, and implementing
common utilities. Just clone or use this template, rename the packages, features... and start building your app's
features immediately.

## ✨ Features

This template is packed with the latest libraries and tools from the Android ecosystem:

* **Tech Stack:** 100% [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* **UI:** [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for declarative UI.
    * **Theming:** [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) (Material You) support.
    * **Navigation:** [Compose Navigation 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3)
      for all screen transitions.
* **Architecture:** Follows Google's official "Guide to app architecture".
    * [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) (Model-View-ViewModel).
    * **UI Layer:** State-driven UI with `ViewModel`, `State`, and `Actions`.
    * **Domain Layer:** (Optional but recommended) for business logic.
    * **Data Layer:** `Repository` pattern.
* **Asynchronicity:** [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) & [Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)
  for managing background threads and streams of data.
* **Dependency Injection:** [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for managing dependencies.
* **Networking:** [Ktor Client](https://ktor.io/docs/client-overview.html) for efficient REST API
  communication.
* **Serialization:** [Kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) (used
  with Ktor) for fast and modern JSON parsing.
* **Build Configuration:**
  Kotlin [explicit API mode](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew15.html#explicit-api-mode) is
  enabled across modules to keep public APIs intentional and well-documented.
* **Testing:**
    * **Unit Tests:** [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/)
    * **Screenshot Tests:** [Paparazzi](https://github.com/cashapp/paparazzi)
    * **UI Tests:** [Compose Test Rules](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing) testing both screen orientations and multiple font scales.
    * **Integration Tests:** Instrumented Compose flows cover the full stack—from
      navigation orchestration to feature screens using Hilt-enabled end-to-end journeys and
      parameterized scenarios that sweep multiple font scales and orientations
      via the shared `BaseUiTest` harness.
    * **Test Doubles Philosophy:** The template deliberately avoids runtime
      mocking frameworks. Instead, it ships purpose-built *fakes* that behave
      like lightweight in-memory implementations of production contracts.
      This approach keeps tests fast and deterministic, encourages explicit
      collaboration boundaries, and allows your team to reuse the same fakes
      across unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios without the brittleness
      often introduced by mocks.

### 🌟 Additional Highlights

* **Dynamic system theming:** The `presentation` layer streams system theme and contrast updates,
  maps them through the `data/system-features` module, and applies them across the Compose UI while
  synchronizing system bars for a fully adaptive experience.
* **Offline-first paging:** The `data:items` module layers Room DAOs, Paging 3, and a
  `RemoteMediator` on top of the Ktor client so item feeds stay cached and transparently refresh
  whenever the network is available.
* **Navigation infrastructure:** A dedicated Compose Navigation 3 stack coordinates screen changes
  via a `NavigationManager`, with `Navigator` components observing command channels and handling
  saveable state, back stack pops, and simultaneous navigation requests. All routing code lives in
  the dedicated `presentation:navigation` module so feature modules stay navigation-agnostic and
  decoupled from the implementation details.
* **Snapshot tooling:** The `presentation` module includes a Paparazzi test toolkit featuring a
  custom Pixel 10 Pro XL device profile and helpers that generate day/night parameter sets for rich
  screenshot coverage.
* **Preview ergonomics:** `presentation:previews` packages reusable Compose `@Preview` annotations
  so feature teams can opt into consistent device sizes, light/dark themes, and dynamic color
  toggles without re-declaring boilerplate in every screen file.
* **Coroutine utilities:** The `utils` module ships reusable coroutine extensions such as
  `stateInWhileSubscribed` and `observeConfigurationChanges` for concise and lifecycle-aware state
  management in ViewModels.
* **Build hygiene:** Gradle is configured for Kotlin explicit API mode, context receivers, and the
  Versions Plugin to keep dependencies up to date and compiler flags consistent across modules.
* **Testable system features:** The `data/system-features` module exposes fake managers backed by
  Turbine-based tests, showcasing how to stub system services when exercising the settings feature.
* **Streamlined startup:** A Hilt-enabled `Application`, splash activity, and edge-to-edge
  `HomeActivity` combine with the navigation manager to launch directly into themed Compose content
  with minimal boilerplate.
* **Edge-to-edge ready:** Compose screens are rendered behind the system bars, with window insets
  managed centrally so features automatically inherit full-height layouts.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The repository is laid out as a layered, multi-module Gradle project. Each directory below maps to a
distinct slice of the architecture so teams can develop features independently while keeping
dependencies explicit.

```

├── data/                    # Repository implementations, remote clients, and system services
├── domain/                  # Business rules, models, and use cases shared by features
├── di/                      # Centralized Hilt bindings that wire modules together
├── presentation/            # Compose UI, navigation stack, previews, and design system
├── utils/                   # Cross-cutting helpers (coroutines, lifecycle, etc.)
├── buildSrc/                # Gradle convention plugins and dependency catalogs
└── gradle/, *.gradle.kts    # Build logic, settings, and version configuration
```

### 🗺️ Module Overview

Every Gradle module has a single responsibility. Use the table below to find the code you need:

* **Application shell**
  * `app`: Hosts the `Application`, activities, and wires the dependency graph at runtime.
* **Presentation layer**
  * `presentation:design-system`: Shared Compose theming, typography, and reusable components.
  * `presentation:features:*`: Feature-specific screens such as `items-list`, `item-details`, and
    `home`.
  * `presentation:navigation` & `presentation:navigation-impl`: Navigation contracts and their
    Compose Navigation 3 implementation.
  * `presentation:paparazzi`, `presentation:previews`, `presentation:utils`, `presentation:fixtures`:
    Tooling for previews, snapshot tests, and sample data.
* **Domain layer**
  * `domain:core-models`: Canonical models exchanged between layers.
  * `domain:items`, `domain:settings`, `domain:system-features`: Use cases and business logic per
    feature area.
* **Data layer**
  * `data:items`: Paging, Room cache, and remote mediator for list and detail flows.
  * `data:network`: Ktor client configuration and API definitions.
  * `data:settings`: Persistence for user preferences and configuration toggles.
  * `data:system-features`: Abstractions over device capabilities with test fakes.
* **Dependency injection**
  * `di`: Shared Hilt modules and component wiring consumed across the app.
* **Shared utilities**
  * `utils:lifecycle`: Lifecycle-aware coroutine helpers and Flow extensions reused in ViewModels.

## 🏛️ Architecture (MVVM + Clean)

This template uses a state-driven MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture combined with principles
from Clean Architecture.

* **UI (Compose)**: Observes `State` from the `ViewModel` and sends `Actions` (user actions) to it.
  It is passive and dumb.
* **ViewModel**: Follows
  a [declarative approach](https://proandroiddev.com/loading-initial-data-in-launchedeffect-vs-viewmodel-f1747c20ce62).
  Handles business logic for the screen. It consumes `Actions`, interacts with
  UseCases/Repositories, and exposes a single `State` Flow for the UI to observe.
* **UseCases (Domain Layer)**: (Optional) Encapsulates a single piece of business logic (e.am.,
  `GetUserProfileUseCase`). This makes logic reusable and easier to test.
* **Repository (Data Layer)**: The single source of truth for data. It abstracts away the data
  source (network or local database) and provides a clean API for the `ViewModel` or `UseCases` to
  consume.
